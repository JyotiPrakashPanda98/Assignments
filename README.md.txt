# Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains two projects related to rule engines and weather monitoring systems.

- **Rule Engine with AST**: A simple rule engine application to determine user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and experience using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Real-Time Weather Monitoring System**: A real-time data processing system that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and provides summarized insights.

## Project 1: Rule Engine with AST

### Overview
The Rule Engine uses AST to represent and evaluate rules for user eligibility based on various attributes.

### Dependencies
- Java 11 or higher
- Any necessary libraries (e.g., JSON handling library if applicable)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>


## Project 2: Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

### Overview
This system continuously retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and provides summarized insights for various cities in India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad. The application is designed to monitor temperature changes, dominant weather conditions, and alert users when specific thresholds are exceeded.

### Dependencies
- Java 11 or higher
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- Any necessary libraries for JSON handling (e.g., `org.json`, `Gson`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
